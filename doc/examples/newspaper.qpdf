{p  Four years after first promising to open his financial affairs to public view, Downing Street published a document detailing Cameron's income and tax payments from 2009-10 to 2014-15. The move came after an emotional Cameron admitted to the Conservative party's spring forum that he alone was to blame for the furore caused by his failure to be frank about his profits from anoffshore investment fund. On Monday, Cameron will announce the establishment of a taskforce, led by HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency, to examine the legality of the financial affairs of companies mentioned in the Panama Papers, where documents relating to his father's offshore fund were discovered by the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. }
